# pyRiderList
This program was inspired by managers not being able to analyze their riders and fleets in an efficient way. 
This program allows the user to add and delete records. The user also has the ability to view rider by groups or shift.

In summary, the program provides more detail and will assist in fleet management by having accurate counts per group, and per shift.
